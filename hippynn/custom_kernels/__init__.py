"""
Custom Kernels for hip-nn interaction sum.

This module provides implementations in pytorch, numba, cupy, and triton.

Pytorch implementations take extra memory, but launch faster than numba kernels.
Numba kernels use far less memory, but do come with some launching overhead on GPUs.
Cupy kernels only work on the GPU, but are faster than numba.
Cupy kernels require numba for CPU operations.
Triton custom kernels only work on the GPU, and are generaly faster than CUPY.
Triton kernels revert to numba or pytorch as available on module import.

On import, this module attempts to set the custom kernels as specified by the
user in hippynn.settings.

See the :doc:`/user_guide/ckernels` section of the documentation for more information.

Depending on your available packages, you may have the following options:

* "pytorch": dense pytorch operations.
* "sparse": sparse pytorch operations. Can be faster than pure pytorch for large
  enough systems, and will not require as much memory.
  May require latest pytorch version. Cannot cover all circumstances; should error
  if encountering a result that this implementation cannot cover..
* "numba": numba implementation of custom kernels, beats pytorch-based kernels.
* "cupy": cupy implementation of custom kernels, better than numba
* "triton": triton-based custom kernels, uses auto-tuning and the triton compiler.
  This is usually the best option.

The available items are stored in the variable :data:`hippynn.custom_kernels.CUSTOM_KERNELS_AVAILABLE`.
The active implementation is stored in :data:`hippynn.custom_kernels.CUSTOM_KERNELS_ACTIVE`.

For more information, see :doc:`/user_guide/ckernels`

# Dev notes:
# For a new implmentation, make a new MessagePassingKernels object in your implementation file.
# This will register your implementation with the system.
# Then do the following:
#   - Add your implementation name to _POSSIBLE_CUSTOM_KERNELS
#   - Add an import block for the file to the populate_custom_kernels() function.
# If your custom kernel has constraints on what devices or hardware configurations are possible,
# the have your module raise an ImportError. You may also want to use
# warnings.warn to warn the user of why the implementation is not available.
