We hope you enjoy your stay.

What is hippynn?
================

`hippynn` is a python library for machine learning on atomistic systems.
We aim to provide high-performance modular design so that different
components can be re-used, extended, or added to. You can find more information
at the :doc:`/user_guide/features` page. The development home is located
at `the hippynn github repository`_, which also contains `many example files`_

The main components of hippynn are constructing models, loading databases,
training the models to those databases, making predictions on new databases,
and interfacing with other atomistic codes. In particular, we provide interfaces
to `ASE`_ (prediction), `PYSEQM`_ (training/prediction), and `LAMMPS`_ (prediction).

Multiple formats for training data are supported, including
Numpy arrays, the ASE Database, `fitSNAP`_ JSON format, and `ANI HDF5 files`_.
