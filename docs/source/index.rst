What is hippynn?
================

`hippynn` is a python library for machine learning on atomistic systems.
We aim to provide high-performance modular design so that different
components can be re-used, extended, or added to. You can find more information
at the :doc:`/user_guide/features` page. The development home is located
at `the hippynn github repository`_.
