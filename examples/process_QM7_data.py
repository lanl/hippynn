# This script extracts data from file the file qm7.mat, which can be 
# downloaded from http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/, and saves the data
# to .npy files formatted as Numpy arrays. A few adjustments are made so that
# the .npy files are ready to be read by the example scripts for hippynn.

# BEFORE RUNNING: Copy this file to a folder datasets/qm7_processed/, where datasets/ 
# is at the same level as hippynn/. Ensure that the file qm7.mat is also present in 
# that folder. Execute this script from that folder.
